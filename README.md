# Game of Life

Welcome to the Game of Life project! This application allows you to explore and interact with the fascinating world of cellular automata, specifically focusing on Conway’s Game of Life. Users can create custom patterns, experiment with rule variations, and visualize the evolution of the grid over time.

## Getting Started


### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@git.nexed.com:game-of-life/game-of-life.git
   cd game-of-life
   ```

2. **Set up the project**:
   - Ensure your web server is pointing to the `public` directory of the project.
   - Configure your web server to serve the project.

3. **Run the application**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the local URL where your server is hosting the project (e.g., `http://localhost/game-of-life`).

### Running Tests

To manually test the application, simply interact with the Game of Life interface through your web browser. Ensure that all expected behaviors (e.g., cell toggling, simulation controls) work as intended.

### Deployment

To deploy the project, move the project files to your production server's web directory and configure the server to point to the `public` directory.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click on cells to toggle their state (alive or dead).
- **Pattern Library**: Load predefined patterns or save your custom configurations.
- **Visualization Controls**: Play, pause, or step through the simulation at your own pace.
- **Data Analysis**: View real-time statistics about the grid’s evolution.
